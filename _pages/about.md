Hey, I’m Elena. I’m a a research associate in the <a href="https://www.imw.fraunhofer.de/en/research/regional-development-innovation/data-science-for-innovation.html">Data Science for Innovation Group</a> at Fraunhofer IMW 
      and a first-year Ph.D. student at the MaiNLP research group <a href="https://mainlp.github.io/">MaiNLP research group</a> 
      (Center for Information and Language Processing, LMU Munich). My supervisors are <a href="https://bplank.github.io/">Barbara Plank</a> 
       and <a href="https://robvanderg.github.io/">Rob von der Goot</a>.
      

My primary focus lies in applied Natural Language Processing. I work on cross-domain NLP and information extraction from unstructured text, particularly in the area of computational job market analysis. I am interested in machine learning with limited data—a common scenario in applied applications—utilizing  weakly-supervised techniques. Moreover, I research in the field of career path prediction.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
